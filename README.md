# Polygon Area Calculator

Use object oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit methods and attributes.

## Overview

### Rules

When a Rectangle object is created, it should be initialized with width and height attributes. The class should also contain the following methods:

- set_width
- set_height
- get_area: Returns area (width * height)
- get_perimeter: Returns perimeter (2 * width + 2 * height)
- get_diagonal: Returns diagonal ((width ** 2 + height ** 2) ** .5)
- get_picture: Returns a string that represents the shape using lines of ' * ' . The number of lines should be equal to the height and the number of ' * ' in each line should be equal to the width. There should be a new line (\n) at the end of each line. If the width or height is larger than 50, this should return the string: "Too big for picture.".
- get_amount_inside: Takes another shape (square or rectangle) as an argument. Returns the number of times the passed in shape could fit inside the shape (with no rotations). For instance, a rectangle with a width of 4 and a height of 8 could fit in two squares with sides of 4.
- Additionally, if an instance of a Rectangle is represented as a string, it should look like: Rectangle(width=5, height=10)

Now the square subclass, this class:

- Should be a subclass of Rectangle. When a Square object is created, a single side length is passed in. The \_\_init\_\_ method should store the side length in both the width and height attributes from the Rectangle class.

- Should be able to access the Rectangle class methods but should also contain a set_side method. If an instance of a Square is represented as a string, it should look like: Square(side=9)

- Additionally, the set_width and set_height methods on the Square class should set both the width and height.

### Testing

The unit tests for this project are in test_module.py. We are running the tests from test_module.py in main.py for your convenience. The tests will run automatically whenever you hit the "run" button. Alternatively you may run the tests by inputting pytest in the console.

### Executing program

-   Run the main.py script in terminal

```
python main.py
```

## My process

### Built with

-   Python 3.9.12 

### What I learned

Get the name of a class.

```python
f'{self.__class__.__qualname__}(width={self.width},height={self.height})'

```
